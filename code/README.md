# Code
This file contains all the R code for the Harbor seal repository including:

- Diagnostics, parametizations and summaries of generalized linear models (GLM_Analysis.R)
  - Part 1: Checking for a significant difference in noise levels between the two waterfront locations.
  - Part 2: Combining waterfront and marina data to find appropriate distribution and model.
  - Part 3: Parametizing GLMs and running AICc to find best model.
  - Part 4: Running predict function to break down and analyze the interation between site and noise level.
  
- Analysis of the candidate model's significant predictors (Predictors.R)
  - Part 1: Checking for month's significance on the number of harbor seals hauled-out.
  - Part 2: Checking for time of day's significance on the number of harbor seals hauled-out.
  
- Figures of the results (Figures.R)
  - Part 1: Harbor seal haul-out distribution.
  - Part 2: Harbor seal haul-out according to month.
  - Part 3: Noise level between sites.
  - Part 4: Harbor seal haul-outs according to noise levels between sites.
