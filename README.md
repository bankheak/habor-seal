# Habor seal
This repository contains the contents for Kyra Bankhead's undergraduate project 'Effects of anthropogenic noise on haul-out numbers of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina)'

## Description
To determine potential impacts of anthropogenic noise on haul-out behavior, we compared numbers of hauled-out harbor seals relative to in-air noise levels at two sites in Washington State, USA —one close to human activities (Bellingham waterfront) and one away from them (Semiahmoo marina)— between July 2020 and August 2021. We used Generalized Linear Models to identify predictors of seal numbers. Results indicate that in-air noise levels may influence seal numbers at sites where human activities are low. They also suggest that, besides hauling-out at night, seals may become tolerant to in-air noise levels at sites where human activities are high.
